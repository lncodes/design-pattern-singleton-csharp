<h2 id="introduction">üåü Introduction</h2>

This repository is a submodule of the [singleton-design-pattern](https://github.com/lncodes/singleton-design-pattern) repository and contains various implementations of the Singleton design pattern in C#. It includes different types of Singleton design patterns, such as Eager Initialization Singleton, Lazy Initialization Singleton, Thread-Safe Lazy Singleton, and more.

<h2 id="installation">üì¶ Installation</h2>

To set up this C# project on your local machine, ensure that the system requirements are met, and then follow these instructions:

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

- **.NET SDK:** Version 8 or later ([Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)).

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.

<h3>Steps to Install</h3>

1. **Clone or Download the Project**

    - **Clone the Repository**
    
      Use Git to create a local copy by executing the following command:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/lncodes/singleton-design-pattern-csharp.git
      ```

    - **Download as ZIP**

      If Git is not available, you can download the project as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository by clicking the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù button and selecting the ‚ÄúDownload ZIP" option.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    Navigate to the project directory containing the source files by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    cd singleton-design-pattern-csharp/src
    ```

    > **Note:** Make sure you're in the correct parent directory where the `singleton-design-pattern-csharp` folder is located.
    
3. **Restore Dependencies**

    Install all required packages and libraries by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

    This command uses NuGet to download and install the dependencies specified in the project‚Äôs configuration files.

<h2 id="usage">üßë‚Äçüíª Usage</h2>

To use the Singleton design pattern from this repository in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Run Unit Tests (Optional but Recommended)**

    To ensure that the implementation is functioning correctly, it is recommended to run the unit tests provided in the repository. To run the tests, open a command line or terminal in the project directory and use the following command:

      ```bash
      dotnet test
      ```

    This command will run all unit tests in the project and show which tests passed or failed.

2. **Select and Copy Singleton File**

    Browse the repository to locate the Singleton design pattern that aligns with your project‚Äôs requirements. For example, if `EagerSingleton.cs` seems like a suitable choice, copy this file from the repository. Ensure the selected Singleton design pattern file meets your project‚Äôs requirements for efficient resource management and proper functionality within the application.

3. **Use the Singleton File in the Project**

    Paste the copied Singleton file into your project‚Äôs solution. To use the Singleton in your application, access the instance as follows:

    ```csharp
    var singletonInstance = EagerSingleton.GetInstance();
    // Use the singleton instance as needed within the application
    ```

    Ensure that `EagerSingleton` is replaced with the name of the chosen class to guarantee the correct Singleton instance is used in the application.
